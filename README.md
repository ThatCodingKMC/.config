# ThatOneKMC's Development Environment

This repository has everything that is needed to setup my development environment. This is done by running one command as mentioned in the installation section of this README.

My development environment is composed of nvim, tmux, and soon to be added zsh. Many plugins are used with these tools. Note that I use "space" as my leader for nvim and "Ctrl" + "a" for my tmux leader.

## Installation
Installation requires that you already have git installed. To install and have everything setup as I like it, you just have to run the one bash command below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThatCodingKMC/.config ~/.config && ~/.config/RUNME.sh
```

Note that if you already have contents in your ~/.config folder the command will not run. I suggest simply renaming your folder and rerunning the command.

## Usage

When I get around to it I will list of the commands/hotkeys unique to my setup here and any other usage tips.

- You can reload tmux configs using "leader" + "r"
- Moving between split panels is done with "Ctrl" + vim keys. This works across vim/tmux panel boundaries.
